Collection of all presentations 

You can find the latex source code, pictures, etc.

Caveats: 
 * If you try to compile them, it will not work fully due to images being in other folders around my computer
 * Pdfs are not attached due to large file size. However, in each folder's README I will try to provide links to my website to download the full pdf. 
 * Note that some pdfs have animations embedded. There can only be viewed using Acrobat Reader/Pro.
